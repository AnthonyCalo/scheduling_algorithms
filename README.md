# scheduling_algorithms
This program simulates an operating systems scheduling josb by reading a list of jobs and executes 3 separate scheduling algorithms
1. round robin
2. shortest process next 
3. priority queues

This program takes an object oriented approach with the 3 algorithsm inheriting the from the abstract base class
